the question's difficulty. This tiered setup adds challenge and
excitement, encouraging users to try harder questions for more
money. The limited question selection allows for careful curation,
ensuring a varied and high-quality quiz for different interests. With
different difficulty levels, the quiz stays interesting and gives users
a sense of accomplishment as they progress. Overall, it's a simple
